    Elevation
		The distance from the transducer face to the point of observation, starting at zero and decreasing .
        
    Ensemble	
        A group of velocity measurements processing processed together in the elevation dimension. Ensembles may be the result of a single ADCP ping, or may be the result of combinations of pings or extrapolation between adjacent ensembles .

    Observation
        An instance of class ADCP_Data class resulting from the reading of a single raw instrument file (before binning or averaging of data form multiple input files).

    Transect 	
        An ADCP observation where the instrument points downward from the surface, and moves horizontally to generate measures of velocity from different locations in the body of water.
